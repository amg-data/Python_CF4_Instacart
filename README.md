# Python_CF4_Instacart

Project: Data Analysis - Python using Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook platform and VS Code editor via an Anaconda distribution for package management and deployment 

This project is an analytics-based client report created for company stakeholders that resolves key business questions. Additionally, the Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks, Python generated image files for the data visualizations, the data dictionary, and data files used to address these key questions were provided to the technical team.

**Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for training purposes.**

## Introduction & Objectives
 
I am an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Key Questions

* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ:
* For example:
    * What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
    * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    * Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
    * What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    * What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? 

## Data & Tools

Data is open-source and provided by Instacart. An additional customer dataset is created and provided for the purpose of this training.<br/>

## Deliverables & Criteria

* Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.
* Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks, the Anaconda libraries manager, and Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
* All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
* Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.
* All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes descriptive comments.
* All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
* Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
* Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.
* All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.
* Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis, all column names are self-explanatory, and all identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.
* Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.
* Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created, all subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.
* Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
* At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.
* Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.
* Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
* Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets.
